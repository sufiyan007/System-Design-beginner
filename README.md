## 1. Core Foundations

### System Design â€” What & Why
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Designing the **architecture and components** of a system to meet requirements for **scale, performance, reliability, and cost**.

<details>
<summary>Open for easy explanation, internals, examples, tradeâ€‘offs</summary>

**Easy explanation:** Itâ€™s the blueprint: break the product into services, data stores, caches, queues, and define how they talk.

**How it works:** Gather requirements â†’ define APIs & data flows â†’ choose storage, caching, consistency, and failure handling â†’ estimate capacity.

**Realâ€‘world:** WhatsApp (mass messaging), Instagram (media feed at scale), Zomato (search + orders + delivery).

**When/Why:** Interviews test your ability to reason about tradeâ€‘offs and growth; on job, it avoids costly redesigns.

**Pitfalls:** Jumping to tech names before requirements; ignoring constraints (latency, throughput, SLA, cost).
</details>

### HLD vs LLD
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** **HLD** = big blocks and interactions; **LLD** = internal class/model logic of each block.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
**HLD:** services, DB choices, APIs, scaling, failure modes.  
**LLD:** data models, classes, method contracts, DB schema.

**Example:** Chat app HLD (Gateway, Messaging Service, Store). LLD (Message entity, repository, idempotency key).

**Tip:** Start with HLD on whiteboard, then drill one or two blocks to LLD depth if asked.
</details>

### How the Web Works (DNS â†’ TCP/TLS â†’ HTTP)
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Browser resolves **domain â†’ IP (DNS)**, opens **TCP/TLS**, sends **HTTP** request, gets response.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
**Flow:** URL typed â†’ DNS lookup â†’ get server IP â†’ TCP 3â€‘way handshake â†’ (HTTPS: TLS handshake) â†’ HTTP GET/POST â†’ server builds response â†’ browser renders.

**Why it matters:** Knowing the path helps you place caches, CDNs, and diagnose latency.
</details>

### Networking Basics: TCP vs UDP
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** **TCP** reliable, ordered; **UDP** fast, no guarantees.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
**Use TCP:** web, DB, emails. **Use UDP:** streaming, gaming, voice (where delay beats perfect delivery).

**Internals:** TCP handshake, retransmission, flow/ congestion control. UDP = fireâ€‘andâ€‘forget datagrams.
</details>

### REST APIs & HTTP Methods
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** **Nounâ€‘based endpoints**, use HTTP verbs: **GET** read, **POST** create, **PUT/PATCH** update, **DELETE** remove.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
**Principles:** stateless, proper status codes, auth, pagination, rate limits, versioning (`/v1`).  
**Example:** `GET /users/42`, `POST /orders`, `PATCH /users/42`.
</details>

### HTTP Status Codes
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** 2xx success, 3xx redirect, 4xx client error, 5xx server error.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
**Know these:** 200 OK, 201 Created, 204 No Content, 301/302 Redirect, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 409 Conflict, 422 Unprocessable, 429 Too Many Requests, 500 Internal Error, 502/503/504 Upstream/Overload/Timeout.
</details>

### OS Basics
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** **Process** = program with its own memory; **Thread** = lightweight execution unit sharing process memory.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
**Concurrency vs Parallelism:** Interleaving vs truly simultaneous on multiple cores.  
**Blocking vs Nonâ€‘blocking I/O:** Thread waits vs continues and gets callback/poll later.  
**Why it matters:** Determines server model (threadâ€‘perâ€‘request vs async/reactor) and capacity.
</details>

## 2. Core Building Blocks

### Monolith vs Microservices
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Start simple (monolith); split into microservices when **scale, team size, or deployment velocity** demands.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
**Monolith pros:** Simple dev/deploy, easy transactions, less ops. **Cons:** Slower deploys at scale, tight coupling.  
**Microservices pros:** Independent scaling/deploys, fault isolation, tech heterogeneity. **Cons:** Network complexity, distributed data, observability needed.  
**Migration tip:** Strangle patternâ€”extract one bounded context at a time.
</details>

### Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** **Vertical** = bigger box; **Horizontal** = more boxes behind a load balancer.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
Vertical quick but capped; horizontal elastic, HA friendly. Use autoscaling + stateless services for horizontal.
</details>

### Stateful vs Stateless Systems
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Stateless scales easier; stateful needs sticky sessions or shared state.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
Keep app stateless; keep state in managed stores (DB, cache). If session needed, use JWT or shared session store (Redis). Avoid nodeâ€‘local sessions.
</details>

### Caching (Client, CDN, Server)
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Put hot data closer to users to cut latency and DB load.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
**Client:** browser cache headers. **CDN:** static assets, media. **Server:** Redis/Memcached for DB results, computed views.  
**Patterns:** readâ€‘through, writeâ€‘through, writeâ€‘back, cacheâ€‘aside. **Keys:** TTLs, invalidation on writes.
</details>

### Cache Eviction (LRU, LFU, TTL)
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** When full, evict **Leastâ€‘Recentlyâ€‘Used** or **Leastâ€‘Frequentlyâ€‘Used**; always set sane **TTLs**.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
**LRU:** great for temporal locality (feeds). **LFU:** stable hotkeys (popular products). Combine with TTL to prevent staleness.
</details>

### Databases: SQL vs NoSQL
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** **SQL** for transactions and relations; **NoSQL** for flexible schema and scale.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
**SQL (MySQL/Postgres):** joins, ACID, strong consistency.  
**NoSQL:** keyâ€‘value (Redis), document (MongoDB), wideâ€‘column (Cassandra), graph (Neo4j). Choose by access patterns.
</details>

### Indexing (Primary, Secondary)
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Index = fast lookup structure; speeds reads, slows writes a bit.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
**Primary:** unique id lookup. **Secondary:** by email/date/status. Use covering indexes, watch write amplification.
</details>

### Sharding, Replication, Partitioning
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** **Replication** for availability; **Sharding** for scale; **Partitioning** is the general split.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
**Replication:** leader/follower, read replicas, failover.  
**Sharding:** range, hash, geo; needs routing (consistent hashing).  
**Partitioning:** by rows (horizontal) or columns (vertical). Keep hot shards small; rebalance proactively.
</details>

### Load Balancing (algorithms & layers)
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Distribute requests using **Roundâ€‘Robin/Leastâ€‘Connections/IPâ€‘Hash** at **L4 (fast)** or **L7 (smart)**.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
**L4:** routes by IP/port; protocolâ€‘agnostic. **L7:** routes by URL/cookies/headers (A/B, canary). Health checks, timeouts, retries are essential.
</details>

### Message Queues & Eventâ€‘Driven
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Use queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ/SQS) to **decouple**, absorb spikes, and process **async**.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
**Patterns:** producer â†’ topic/queue â†’ consumer(s); fanâ€‘out; deadâ€‘letter queues.  
**Kafka:** high throughput, ordered partitions, retention. **RabbitMQ:** routing patterns, ack/nack. **SQS:** managed, simple.
</details>

### CDN (Cloudflare, Akamai)
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Edge cache for static (and some dynamic) content to cut latency worldwide.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
Use signed URLs, cacheâ€‘control headers, origin shield. Put images/video on object storage + CDN (e.g., S3 + CloudFront/Cloudflare).
</details>

### Storage Systems (Block, File, Object)
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** **Block** = disks for DB; **File** = shared filesystem; **Object** = blobs at massive scale.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
**Block (EBS):** lowâ€‘latency, mount to one host. **File (EFS/NFS):** POSIX, multiâ€‘attach. **Object (S3):** eventual consistency, versioning, lifecycle policies.
</details>

---

## 3. Essential System Design Concepts

### Scalability, Latency, Throughput
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Scale = handle more load; Latency = time per request; Throughput = requests per second.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
Optimize latency with caches, CDNs, locality; throughput with horizontal scale, batching, async. Measure P50/P90/P99.
</details>

### CAP Theorem
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** In a partition, you can choose **Consistency or Availability**, not both.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
Most real systems are **AP (eventual)** or **CP (consistent)** depending on domain: feeds vs finance.
</details>

### Consistency Models (Strong, Eventual, Causal)
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Strong = latest always; Eventual = converges; Causal = respects causeâ€‘beforeâ€‘effect.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
Pick based on UX: likes can be eventual; balances should be strong; social graphs often causal.
</details>

### ACID Transactions
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** **Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable**â€”reliable multiâ€‘step DB changes.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
Isolation levels (Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable). Use transactions for payments, inventory.
</details>

### Rate Limiting (Token/Leaky Bucket)
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Control request rate per user/IP to protect systems.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
**Token bucket:** allows bursts; **Leaky bucket:** smooths. Return **429** on exceed; implement at gateway with Redis counters.
</details>

### API Design Principles (REST, versioning, pagination)
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Clean nouns, proper verbs/codes, **/v1** versioning, **pagination** for lists.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
**Pagination:** limit & offset (simple) vs cursor/keyset (stable at scale). Include `next_cursor`.
</details>

### API Pagination (Offset vs Cursor)
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Offset is easy but slow for deep pages; Cursor is fast and consistent under writes.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
Use cursor for feeds/logs; offset for admin tools and small datasets.
</details>

---

## 4. Scalability & Reliability Patterns

### Fault Tolerance
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Design to **keep working** when parts fail.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
Redundancy, health checks, timeouts, retries, graceful degradation (serve cached data if DB down).
</details>

### Redundancy & Failover (Activeâ€‘Passive, Activeâ€‘Active)
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Keep **spares**; switch on failure (passive) or share load (activeâ€‘active).

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
Activeâ€‘passive simpler (promotion time). Activeâ€‘active needs conflict resolution (multiâ€‘primary DBs).
</details>

### Autoâ€‘Scaling
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Scale instance count automatically by metrics (CPU/RPS/lag).

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
Warmâ€‘up, min/max bounds, scaleâ€‘in protection, predictive vs reactive policies.
</details>

### Circuit Breaker, Retry/Backoff
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Stop hammering a failing dependency; retry carefully with **exponential backoff + jitter**.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
States: closed â†’ open (on error threshold) â†’ halfâ€‘open (probe). Combine with timeouts and bulkheads.
</details>

### Idempotency
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Same request repeated â‡’ same effect. Critical for retries (e.g., payments).

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
Use idempotency keys for POST; PUT is naturally idempotent; design DB constraints to enforce onceâ€‘only actions.
</details>

### Distributed Locks
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Ensure only one worker performs a critical action at a time.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
Use Redis (SET NX PX) or Zookeeper/Consul; add expirations; consider fencing tokens to avoid splitâ€‘brain.
</details>

## 5. Security Basics

### HTTPS/TLS
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Encrypt traffic to prevent snooping/tampering.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
Certificates, TLS handshake, HSTS, perfect forward secrecy. Always HTTPS for auth and APIs.
</details>

### Authentication vs Authorization
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** **AuthN** = who you are; **AuthZ** = what you can do.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
Separate concerns; principle of least privilege; roleâ€‘/attributeâ€‘based access control.
</details>

### OAuth2 & JWT
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** OAuth2 issues access tokens; **JWT** is a signed token carrying claims.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
Store shortâ€‘lived access tokens, refresh tokens; verify signatures; rotate keys; avoid putting secrets in JWT payload.
</details>

### CORS
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Browser policy that restricts crossâ€‘origin requests unless the server allows them.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
Set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` precisely; preflight (OPTIONS) for nonâ€‘simple requests.
</details>

### API Throttling
**Interview oneâ€‘liner:** Enforce perâ€‘key/IP limits; return **429**; protect downstreams.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
Implement at API gateway or edge; differentiate hard vs soft limits; expose headers for remaining quota.
</details>

**CI/CD:** Rollouts, canary/blueâ€‘green; config as code.
</details>

---

## Final Cheatâ€‘Sheet (say it like this)
- **Start with requirements** (users, RPS, latency, data volume, SLAs).  
- **Sketch HLD** (clients, gateways, services, DBs, caches, queues, CDN, LB).  
- **Call out tradeâ€‘offs** (SQL vs NoSQL, consistency vs availability, cost vs latency).  
- **Plan for failures** (timeouts, retries, circuit breakers, fallbacks).  
- **Plan scale** (stateless services + horizontal scale + autoscaling).  
- **Security first** (HTTPS, auth, authZ, rate limits).  
- **Measure** (logs/metrics/traces; P99 latency).  
- **Close with evolution** (MVP today, how to scale next: shard, cache, async).
